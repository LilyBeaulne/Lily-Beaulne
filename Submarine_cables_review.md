Abstract: This blog takes a look into how the world is connected by fiber optic cables something most people don't know about.  It's made to explain the lengths and innovation humanity took to make the worlds countries accessible to one another. Showing where each cable starts from, the paaths they take and where they end.

# Submarine Cables ∘˙○˚.•

## intro

Underwater fiber optic cables! There are so many and yet so few people know about them when it's the thing that mainly brings internet to our world. So I decided to [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1iKWbHvLQHEoA3LHhRvxYPKgvtukw4X4&ll=13.622467592156205%2C0&z=2) ones that I thought 
were important, interesting, or had a cool shape.  ヽ(•‿•)ノ

To start, I placed the tat-8 cable which was the first underwater optic cable. I did this to link a timeline that I made to 
my map, almost like I was networking (wink wink). Then I moved on to finding cables with importance, like AAE-1 & TSE-1. 
After more searching I came to realize that not all cables would have significance to them. So, I transitioned onto ones that had an 
interesting name to them (POSEIDON) or entertaining shape (SAM-1). It was amusing to find out about future cables to be 
built, and just how far they are expected to go. “Far north fiber” and “Polar express” set out to cover 29,650 km combined, 
and basically covers the top half of my!! The future of underwater fiber optic cables is expanding...

# Surprises

I was surprised at first to find out how many cables become decommissioned; logically it makes sense with the scale of the 
projects and amount it would cost, but I’d assume you’d want to finish something like that when you garner the benefits in 
the end. Another surprise was that some cables become abandoned, some due to the harsh conditions under the water but for 
others where that's not the case, it takes about 25 years to stop working. Not surprising, but an “oh” moment was noticing 
how North Korea has no cables connected to it, which just demonstrated how isolated the citizens must be.

# Learned?

With the help of this assignment I learned that undersea cables are what really bring internet to the world, not satellites. 
They transmit 99% of international data and help with international trade, connecting advanced economies[^1]. Cables also 
cost a pretty penny, with trans-oceanic ones costing upward of $250-$400 million dollars! \(๑•́o•̀๑)/ 
The future for submarine cables also looks bright, as the growth of data and internet in the world leads to a need for new 
cables which in the end will help the global economy[^2]. Another fact was that when cables can no longer be used or 
repaired, they are then used for scientific research.

# Experience

Making the map was a fun experience, researching helped me to learn where the most common landing points for cables are and 
new places I didn’t even know existed! Through this assignment I came to have more appreciation for those that make maps, 
as I would have trouble getting the lines to bend how I want to avoid land, or when the line would discontinue, and I'd have 
to start over. It's a very time-consuming process if you’re going for a certain look, but in the end, I did enjoy seeing my 
map unfold into something bigger and the final product was something I am happy with. (⁀ᗢ⁀)

# Uniqueness

My map is unique because of the bias I put into it. I picked and researched the cables that made it onto the final map, along 
with placing every landing point and connecting them to lines making it actually look like the directions the cables go in 
under water. Though some cables were picked at random as I wanted to fill in space on the map to give more geographical 
context.

## Conclusion

Compared to the timeline assignment, I had to do more research for this one. Finding where each cable starts, stops and 
connects, while also having to be selective in which cables I chose. Where on the other hand I just had to pick which piece 
of information seemed more important in the grand scheme of things for the timeline. 

With the map I was trying to give geographical context to the extensive scale of underwater optic cables, and that even with 
how little I chose to display there is still global coverage. Meaning that with some envisioning seeing how interconnected 
the world is becomes eye opening. 

I think I preferred making the map more, the timeline was simple, and I felt like I was more hands on in the creation of 
this. I also learned more about fiber optic cables of the present and future instead of the past which is better as time only 
moves forward. 

I didn't include that many pictures because of copyright, but I think my map has enough imagery on it's own.

My biggest help was Submarine cable map, as it told me the landing points of each cable along with the general shape I should 
make my line in.

<!-- review by lily
Communication, style, and polish (4/5): Is the written content clear and concise, with a logical flow? Does the author have an engaging writing style, which grabs the reader's attention? Are there any grammar or spelling errors?  

 

There is an engaging tone, very clearly an online blog 

A cool juxtaposition to the content of the map 

Underwater fiber optic cables do sound uninteresting at first but you make it fun 

Use of fun emoticons draws in the reader and makes the tone more fun and conversational 

The flow of sentences is a bit awkward in some places, yet still understandable.  

Ex. “There are so many and yet so few people know about them when it's the thing that mainly brings internet to our world.”  

Suggested edit: 

They’re incredibly abundant, yet remain largely unrecognized despite being the very backbone bringing the internet to our world 

Missing word here	 

 

 

I think this sentence could benefit from editing. ‘Garner’ doesn't necessarily make sense in this context, so I don't exactly understand this one.:  

“It makes sense with the scale of the projects and amount it would cost, but I’d assume you’d want to finish something like that when you garner the benefits in the end.” 

 

I think the structure of the blog makes sense.  

I like the inclusion of different subsections.  

Could edit the subsection titles 

Suprises -> What Surprised me 

Learned? -> What I Learned 

Experience -> My Experience 

Uniqueness -> Positionality 

The uniqueness you talk about seems more so about your own bias and positionality when creating the map rather than how unique the map itself is. 

I think this piece could benefit from an overall look at sentence flow and some small grammatical errors. 

 This piece is engaging and creative. It takes a clear fun tone where the reader is coming along for the journey of making the map and researching with you.  

References look good 

Typo in abstract 

“paaths” 

Relevance to special issue theme (3/5): Is the submission a good fit for the journal? For authors who are submitting to CTRL+ALT+DH, does it relate strongly to the issue theme of creativity in digital spaces, or is it only loosely connected? Are there other ways that their work connects, which could be further explored? Do you know of any articles or other sources, which might be helpful to the author? See: CTRL+ALT+DH Call for Papers.  

I don't think this piece necessarily connects to our journal theme of creativity in digital spaces. 

I think exploring more the method of making the map would help relate this more to our overall topic as you used digital tools to create the map, a creative visual 

This is definitely more connected to the ‘digital’ part of the theme, looking at how the ‘digital’ is actually enabled through tangible real work labour and structures.  

I do think there is an interesting avenue to explore here in how creativity in digital spaces is enables by the physical and tangible real-world work of others 

 

Overall originality, creativity, and strength of ideas (5/5): Are the ideas unique and compelling? Does the author offer an original point-of-view?  

You write about a timeline that you linked to your map 

Maybe you could include a link directly to this timeline for those who are interested to check out 

Could help give context to the conclusion part of the work 

Maybe explain why certain cables are important and others aren’t 

You say that some are significant and others arent, but why? 

This is definitely very original 

both in writing style and the actual content.  

I personally haven't seen anything like this, or really on this topic 

I found the mentioning that North Korea had no cables connected to it very interesting, something I never would have known or thought about before reading this  

I do wish there was a bit more engagement with the map itself. 

You do include a screen shot and talk about the specific North Korean Part 

 

Accuracy and completion of Markdown code (4/5): Does the Markdown file include metadata, with the title, date, issue, author, citation, tags, abstract, and bio, etc (see below)? Are the headings properly formatted? Do the links work? Are the images properly sized? If there are citations, are they properly encoded? For an example of how to format metadata and footnotes, check out the CTRL+ALT+DH Issue 2 article, "Writing Against Erasure" (raw Markdown Code vs final published article). See also: Markdown Guide. 

the markdown over all looks good 

Could separate sentences line by line to make locating errors and referencing specific parts of the code easier 

Better for collaboration? 

 great inclusion of link to map 

 photos are included  

They are properly sized and encoded 

Alt text provides link to source of photos 

Alt text should include some sort of description of the photo 

Not included in your alt text 

 

-  metadata is good, including title, date, tags, abstract 

- headings are properly formated 

- Capitalize the i in ‘intro’ 

You could have included a larger heading with the title before the intro heading 

Ex.   

#Submarine Cables ∘˙○˚. 

For the citations, the markdown needs to be edited slightly as they show up as body text instead of an actual citation 

 

 

make sure to put a colon after the citation indictor in line 80 and 82  

Example:  80      [^1]: Phil Edwards ..... 

That way when you click on the intext citation it will actually bring you down to the correct bibliographic citation 

 

3) At the bottom of your review, score each of the sections (out of 5) and tally the total score (out of 20). 

 

Total score:  16/20 

Overall, great work! I enjoyed reading. it was interesting not only because it was a unique topic, but also because of your engaging writing style.
